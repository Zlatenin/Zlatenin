### Hi thereðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

I'm Miguel Eduardo. I've been breathing IT since I had use of conscience. I've learnt and practiced all kind of stuff in my life from graphics design, web design, server administration to programming, etc. I've had more of ten years of experience in IT Maintenance, from computers maintenance workshops to building and setting up company's computer networks. Now I'm focusing on cloud computing and python, and I wish to improve my knowledge on these areas wherever I can.
